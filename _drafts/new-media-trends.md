title: Are Social Media Stars Dictators?
---

I'm a glass half full person. My brain naturally looks for a silver lining to almost any situation. This is not necessarily healthier or better than being more of a pessimist. For example, the disconnect recently with world politics, especially national politics where I live in America has been tough on me. My poor little brain has to work extra hard to try and find that ever more elusive silver lining.

The world is changing fast, with technology enabling us to do more, faster. To connect to almost anyone instantly. To find the exact information we want from anywhere. This is great. I love it. But there are growing pains. Social networks are incredible. We can find or grow communities of people who share our niche interests, who look at the world like we do. We can connect to and become fans of the leaders of those communities--everything from our favorite let's player, to cooking video tutorials, to the people who are standing up for our religious or political views. But we can get sucked in to a tunnel vision of the world. And those we are fans of can get drunk on the power of their platforms, unchecked in more ways than ever before. This is rare - most people with a check by their name on Twitter are ordinary folk, with influence sure, but not of the magnitude of those at the very, very top. And those at the top often use their platforms to do lots of good. That is great. But a benevolent dictator is still a dictator. I told you I was struggling to find my silver linings! 

We are in the early age of new-media stars. People with millions of fans/followers/bros. People who connect with their community 'directly' via Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or elsewhere. And many in their community resemble the die hard fans we used to expect for cult TV shows or rock stars.

Being part of the Bro Army is not the same as being a David Bowie fan. You are not following something distant. You are connecting with something tangible and within reach. You can comment on Pewdiepie's videos and he may reply. You can tweet at him and he may retweeet it. This makes new-media stars feel far closer to us than rock stars of old. We can, potentially, interact with them one on one. Psychologically, even more importantly is that we enjoy their content on the same platforms, the same feeds, where we often have our personal one on one connections (such as liking a friend's instagram post, or DM'ing them on Twitter).

This closeness to your bespoke chosen star is intoxicating. But it's a false closeness. And therefore a dangerous one. New media stars are engaged in a one to many relationship with their followers. They use intimate channels to spread content in a highly distributed way. Pewdiepie's videos get millions of views each. More than many TV shows I am sure. That scale means he can never engage directly with all of those viewers, or all of the people who comment on his videos. No more than the Beatles could meet everyone at a concert or respond to every fan letter. We get sucked in to having a sense of intimacy with these stars, because they are personally creating and distributing their content with no filter. But the only interactive intimacy we really have is with our feeds--we actively choose who to follow where and how to consume and engage with their content. 

We do not interact with Pewdiepie, we do not interact with therealdonaldtrump. They however get to reach out to us directly, without editor, without approval by a producer or lawyer. They communicate in a personal way. It makes new-media exciting and it makes us far more likely to give these stars our trust. It makes these stars able to act without constraint. These stars can be themselves, without thought for the norms and standards that traditional media has developed over decades or even centuries.

If you are a fan of one of the controversial new-media stars, this unfiltered access to their truthiness is what you signed up for. I get that. But here is the crux of it:

1. millions of followers love them so they can legitimately feel like they are therefore correct if their followers agree with them.
2. they do not need to worry themselves at all with those who disagree with them because those people are not following them, do not contribute to their reach, their bottom line, or their influence
3. the stars therefore live in an echo chamber, potentially surrounded by millions of yes-people. Millions of people who will always support them. 
4. their fans will believe them over third party evidence or perspectives, including (or especially) those from traditional media.
5. so fans can easily exist in an echo chamber of their own
6. this is a positive feedback loop: each cycle reinforces and strengthens the original signal further and further
7. there are few, if any, safety valves to relieve this feedback, however hateful, myopic, or delusional.
8. and so we all collectively grow to have more extreme views, with less exposure to other views, and therefore less ability or desire to seek compromise.

That sucks. I hope new-media evolves to help us manage this. I have some ideas for a silver lining. But I will save them for another day.
