title: I Am Trying Really Hard to Be Glass Half Full
---

I'm a glass half full person. My brain naturally looks for a silver lining to almost any situation. This is not necessarily healthier or better. The disconnect recently with world politics, especially national politics where I live in America has been tough. My poor little brain has to work extra to try and find that ever more elusive silver lining.

The world is changing fast, with technology enabling us to do more, faster. To connect to almost anyone instantly. To find the exact information we want from anywhere. This is great. I love it. But there are growing pains. Social networks are incredible. We can find or grow communities of people who share our niche interests, who look at the world like we do. We can connect to and become fans of the leaders of those communities--everything from our favorite let's player, to cooking video tutorials, to the people who are standing up for our religious or political views. 

We are in the early age of new media stars. People with millions of fans/followers/bros. People who connect with their community 'directly' via Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or elsewhere. And many in their community resemble the die hard fans we used to expect for cult TV shows or rock stars.

It feels different though. If you are a pewdiepie bro you watch the videos one person produces by himself and who talks to the camera as if talking to one person. You are not following something distant. You are connecting with something tangible and within reach. You can comment on Pewdiepie's videos and he may reply. You can tweet at him and he may reply. This makes new media stars feel far closer to us than rock stars of old. We can, potentially, interact with them one on one. We certainly enjoy their content in the exact same channels where we can and often do have our own personal one on one connections (such as liking a friend's instagram post, or DM'ing them on Twitter).

This closeness to your bespoke chosen stars is intoxicating. But it's a false closeness. And therefore a dangerous one. New media stars are engaged in a one to many relationship with their followers. They use intimate channels to spread content in a highly distributed way. Pewdiepie's videos get millions of views each. More than many TV shows I am sure. That scale means he can never engage directly with all of those viewers, or all of the people who comment on his videos. No more than the Beatles could meet everyone at a concert or respond to every fan letter.
