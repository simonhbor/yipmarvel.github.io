I've been produtive-lazy tonight and messed about themeing this blog on the laptop. It's like messing about on the river only less connected to nature, less relaxing, less likely to have songs written about it, but safer to do in the dark.

In case you are wondering, productive-lazy is a definite thing, that I think I just made up. It's sorta like busy work, but less busy, and with more tangible (and useful, goddammit) outputs.

Github pages offers a good number of Jekyll themes. It's good it does because it's very easy to install / switch these around on your Jekyll/Github blog, so it is definitely the path of least resistance. As far as I can tell the theme sets a default page HTML structure and some CSS. So I think that they can be completely ignored if you want to write things from scratch. But I couldn't be bothered :smile:.

Still, fiddling about with getting the combo of my includes, the main content, and layouts working OK together with my added in CSS took me a while. I'm kinda happy with it, but here's what I reserver every right to change:

- the fonts: I like the sans-serif thin heading font and a classic serif body font, but why not endlessly mess around with Google Font combos?
- colors: I would like to have a toggle for a dark theme. My current text colors work well on dark or light actually, which may make it easier. I am going to have to experiment with what Github Pages will let me get away with though in terms of dynamic stuff
- add a link to the home page in the nav area
- get tags showing up on a post page - idealy make these clickable too to get to a list of matching entries
- have categories / tags lists accessible from the nav area too
- change out the emoji icons I am using
- maybe make something cool in css to be some sort of icon for the site (CSS only would be great to keep it super lean)
- if possible have zero javascript in the final rendered site (no good reason for this other than a mild challenge). This would of cousre make a switchable theme impossible :smile:
- oh, and finally - make some kind of about page - maybe with links to anything interesting I do on github, that I can show off at work, or that I throw up on codepen
