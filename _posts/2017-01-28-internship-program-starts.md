We kicked off a new form of tech internships today. Helping local people who are starting out get a quick injection of real world experience to help them get that first developer job.

It was humbling for half a dozen people to want to talk to me after I explained the details. Half a dozen people almost glowing with enthusiasm, looking to change their lives and wanting advice or tips. From me. I didn’t have any inspiring words or insights—all I know is what randomly happened to work out in the end for me.

The idea of getting to help give any of these people that confidence to achieve everything they can is pretty intoxicating. I have a feeling their energy during the internship is going to be pretty contagious too.

I am one of those people who flits between extrovert and introvert. I am perfectly content dealing with coding for hours on end, not talking to anyone. If I am surrounded be people, I can get a real buzz from it. Today I got a buzz and it was fun.

Note to self: as I’ve noted to myself many times before, preparation before speaking publicly always, always, always pays off. And the more preparation the better.
