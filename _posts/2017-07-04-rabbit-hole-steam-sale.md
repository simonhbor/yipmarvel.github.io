title: Rabbit Hole of the Week: Steam Summer Sale
---

So many sweet, sweet games for sale. I wanna play so many sweet, sweet games. Wouldn’t my life be better if I got to play more awesomely sweet games? 

These are my thoughts on running through pages and pages of games on sale during the annual Steam Summer Sale. It’s a perfect storm of bargain hunting, research, and imagining and planning all the fun times that will be had. It’s like going to a high-end food court where all the burgers, pulled pork sliders, hard shakes, char sui buns are a buck each. At such a food court I know, based on bittersweet experience, that my eyes are bigger than my tummy.

I went a little deep on this one. How do I find the best deals for the best games that I will like best? Searching Steam, watching videos with sale tips and suggestions, watching dozens of game reviews from places like IGN.

I have a Steam wishlist, because lists are amazing. Let’s analyse what went down over the sale by he numbers:

- 29: wishlist size before the sale
- 61: peak wishlist massiveness (during sale)
- 13: games / game packs purchased
- 6: games purged from wishlist
- 42: games currently on wishlist

So my list got longer - my gaming backlog is huge, both for games I own and games I want to own. And despite playing a lot of games, watching lots of let’s plays, falling down this rabbit hole was enlightening. The breadth and depth of games out there is great. Game journalism is often thoughtful, insightful, and really helpful. So many creators are doing such interesting work.

And my eyes have been opened to other rabbit holes I will happily let myself explore over the next year (I’m looking at you Roguelikes, Nethack, JRPGs). All of this is 100% unproductive. Watching video game reviews for twenty minutes for a game that’s free or close to free may not make total sense. But it’s not about the end result.

I realized from this Steam Summer Sale that it’s the anticipation and exploring that I enjoy. A chilled journey of discovery into games, even if I never play them, is comforting. It feels productive in the moment even if it isn’t. Maybe reading Shakespeare would be better, but that’s not my realistic choice. It’s gaming research and videos or cartoons. I’m glad that for a couple of weeks gaming videos 100% won.
