I'd looked into Jekyll, Octopress, Hugo and more off and on over the years. I'd seen geeks I look up to like [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com), make the switch from things like WordPress to a static site generator. Turns out it's pretty easy - if you are already a web developer :)

I'm just playing around for now but it is pretty fun. I'm hosting it on Github Pages, which is a bit restrictive, but means I can edit my blog from anywhere, and have done most of it straight on [github.com](github.com). Almost every thing needs to be read up about: how to define tags, how to reference metadata, how to format dates. But liquid seems straightforward, if more verbose than something like [mustach](https://mustache.github.io). 

My one hair pulling event was entirely my own fault - I had added a folder called `_layout` - but it should have been `_layouts`. Doh! 

Of course, the reason it seems to just about make sense to me is because now, as opposed to when I last thought about starting a blog, I am a web developer. I am no expert, but know just enough to tell myself "I could have just built my own custom static blogging engine from scratch." I couldn't. Or rather, I shouldn't because it will take me a very, very long time, and will be painful :(
